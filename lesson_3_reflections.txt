When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When syncing across multiple systems.  When sharing with other people.  Convenient.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling while local commits are not in order can cause confusion.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork can link back to original reporitory. A fork can sync with the change in original repository?
    A clone does not link to the original repository, and does not credit the original author.
    Branch is within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Detect conflicts locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Send source code. Sending is easier.  Tracing the change is harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To allow others to see/comment/control your commit.
    Changing the master is simpler.
